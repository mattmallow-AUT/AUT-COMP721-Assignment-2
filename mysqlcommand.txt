Because it is not specified in the Assignment requirements
whether the lecturer wants the sql table to be created from
the sql server side or from the code written for this assignment.
Since the requirements states we need to draft this txt document
for this assignment. I assume we are creating the tables from
the command line, not in the code. Here are the list of sql queries
I used in creating those tables:

CREATE TABLE A2db(
    bookingRefNo INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    customerName TEXT NOT NULL,
    phoneNumber INT(12) NOT NULL,
    unitNumber TEXT,
    streetNumber TEXT NOT NULL,
    streetName TEXT NOT NULL,
    suburb TEXT,
    destinationSuburb TEXT,
    pickUpDate DATE NOT NULL,
    pickUpTime TIME NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('assigned','unassigned') NOT NULL
);
