Because it is not specified in the Assignment requirements
whether the lecturer wants the sql table to be created from
the sql server side or from the code written for this assignment.
Since the requirements states we need to draft this txt document
for this assignment. I assume we are creating the tables from
the command line, not in the code. Here are the list of sql queries
I used in creating those tables:

CREATE TABLE A2db(
    bookingRefNo int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    customerName text NOT NULL,
    phoneNumber int,
    uniNumber text,
    streetNumber text,
    streetName text,
    suburb text,
    destinationSuburb text,
    pickUpDate date,
    pickUpTime time,
    status text
);
